'''Rock music''' is a [[Music genre|genre]] of [[popular music]] that originated in the United States as "[[rock and roll]]" in the late 1940s and early 1950s, developing into a range of styles from the mid-1960s, primarily in the United States and United Kingdom. It has its roots in rock and roll, a style that drew from the black musical genres of [[blues]] and [[rhythm and blues]], as well as from [[country music]]. Rock also drew strongly from genres such as [[electric blues]] and [[folk music|folk]], and incorporated influences from [[jazz]] and other styles. Rock is typically centered on the [[electric guitar]], usually as part of a rock group with [[electric bass guitar]], [[drum kit|drums]], and one or more singers.

Usually, rock is song-based music with a [[Time signature|{{music|time|4|4}} time signature]] and using a [[verse–chorus form]]; however, the genre has become extremely diverse. Like [[pop music]], lyrics often stress romantic love but also address a wide variety of other themes that are frequently social or political. Rock was the most popular genre of music in the U.S. and much of the [[western world]] from the 1950s up to the 2010s.

Rock musicians in the mid-1960s began to advance the album ahead of the single as the dominant form of recorded music expression and consumption, with [[the Beatles]] at the forefront of this development. Their contributions lent the genre a cultural legitimacy in the mainstream and initiated a rock-informed [[album era]] in the music industry for the next several decades. By the late 1960s "[[classic rock]]" period, a few distinct rock music subgenres had emerged, including hybrids like [[blues rock]], [[folk rock]], [[country rock]], [[southern rock]], [[raga rock]], and [[jazz rock]], which contributed to the development of [[psychedelic rock]], influenced by the countercultural [[psychedelia|psychedelic and hippie scene]]. New genres that emerged included [[progressive rock]], which extended artistic elements, [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], which emphasized an aggressive thick sound, and [[glam rock]], which highlighted showmanship and visual style. In the second half of the 1970s, [[punk rock]] reacted by producing stripped-down, energetic social and political critiques. Punk was an influence in the 1980s on [[New wave music|new wave]], [[post-punk]] and eventually [[alternative rock]].

From the 1990s, alternative rock began to dominate rock music and break into the mainstream in the form of [[grunge]], [[Britpop]], and [[indie rock]]. Further subgenres have since emerged, including [[pop-punk]], [[electronic rock]], [[rap rock]], and [[rap metal]]. Some movements were conscious attempts to revisit rock's history, including the [[garage rock]] and [[post-punk revival|post-punk]] revival in the 2000s. Since the 2010s, rock has lost its position as the pre-eminent popular music genre in world culture, but remains commercially successful. The increased influence of [[hip-hop]] and [[electronic dance music]] can be seen in rock music, notably in the [[techno-pop]] scene of the early 2010s and the pop-punk-hip-hop revival of the 2020s.

Rock has also embodied and served as the vehicle for cultural and social movements, leading to major subcultures including [[mod (subculture)|mods]] and [[rocker (subculture)|rockers]] in the U.K., the [[hippie]] movement and the wider [[Counterculture of the 1960s|western counterculture movement]] that spread out from [[San Francisco]] in the U.S. in the 1960s, the latter of which continues to this day. Similarly, 1970s [[punk culture]] spawned the [[goth subculture|goth]], punk, and [[emo]] subcultures. Inheriting the [[Folk music|folk]] tradition of the [[protest song]], rock music has been [[Rock music and politics|associated with political activism]], as well as changes in social attitudes to race, sex, and drug use, and is often seen as an expression of youth revolt against adult [[conformity]]. At the same time, it has been commercially highly successful, leading to accusations of [[selling out]].{{toclimit|3}}

Furthermore, it typically consists of between three (the [[power trio]]) and five members. Classically, a rock band takes the form of a [[quartet]] whose members cover one or more roles, including vocalist, lead guitarist, rhythm guitarist, bass guitarist, drummer, and often [[keyboard player]] or another instrumentalist.<ref>D. Laing, "Quartet" in {{harvnb|Shepherd|2003}}, p&nbsp;56.</ref>

Since the term "rock" started being used in preference to "rock and roll" from the late 1960s, it has usually been contrasted with pop music, with which it has shared many characteristics; however, rock is often distanced from pop; the former has an emphasis on musicianship, live performance, and a focus on serious and progressive themes as part of an ideology of [[Authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]] that is frequently combined with an awareness of the genre's history and development.<ref name="Warner2003">T. Warner, ''[[iarchive:popmusictechnolo0000warn|Pop Music: Technology and Creativity: Trevor Horn and the Digital Revolution]]'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2003), {{ISBN|0-7546-3132-X}}, pp.&nbsp;3–4.</ref> According to [[Simon Frith]], rock was "something more than pop, something more than rock and roll" and "rock musicians combined an emphasis on skill and technique with the romantic concept of art as artistic expression, original and sincere".<ref name=Warner2003/>

In the new millennium, the term ''rock'' has occasionally been used as a [[blanket term]] including forms like pop music, [[reggae music]], [[soul music]], and even [[hip hop]], which it has been influenced with but often contrasted through much of the latter's history.<ref>R. Beebe, D. Fulbrook and B. Saunders, "Introduction" in R. Beebe, D. Fulbrook, B.

The foundations of rock music are in rock and roll, which originated in the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s; the genre spread to much of the rest of the world. Its origins lay in a melding of various [[African-American music|black musical]] genres of the time, including [[rhythm and blues]] and [[gospel music]], with [[country music|country and western]].<ref name="Bogdanov2002BrithofR&R">R.

Rock and roll has led to a number of distinct subgenres, including rockabilly, combining rock and roll with "hillbilly" country music, which was usually played and recorded in the mid-1950s by white singers such as [[Carl Perkins]], Jerry Lee Lewis, [[Roy Orbison]], [[Buddy Holly]] and with the greatest commercial success, [[Elvis Presley]].<ref name="AllmusicRbilly">{{Citation|title=Rockabilly |work=AllMusic |url={{AllMusic|class=explore|id=style/d187|pure_url=yes}} |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5wQb3jHWo?url=http://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/d187 |archive-date=11 February 2011 |url-status=dead}}.</ref> [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic and Latino American]] movements in rock and roll, which would eventually lead to the success of [[Latin rock]] and [[Chicano rock]] within the US, began to rise in [[Southwestern United States|the Southwest]]; with rock and roll standard musician [[Ritchie Valens]] and even those within other heritage genres, such as [[Al Hurricane]] along with his brothers Tiny Morrie and Baby Gaby as they began combining rock and roll with country-[[Western music (North America)|western]] within traditional [[New Mexico music]].<ref name="Lucero">{{cite web | last=Lucero | first=Mario J. | title=The problem with how the music streaming industry handles data | website=Quartz | date=3 January 2020 | url=https://qz.com/1773480/the-problem-with-how-the-music-streaming-industry-handles-data/ | access-date=14 February 2020 | archive-date=31 March 2023 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230331013320/https://qz.com/1773480/the-problem-with-how-the-music-streaming-industry-handles-data | url-status=live }}</ref> In addition, the 1950s saw the growth in popularity of the electric guitar, and the development of a specifically rock and roll style of playing through such exponents as Chuck Berry, [[Link Wray]], and [[Scotty Moore]].<ref>J.

Commentators have perceived a decline of rock and roll in the late 1950s and early 1960s. By 1959, the death of Buddy Holly, [[the Big Bopper]] and Ritchie Valens in a plane crash, the departure of Elvis for the army, the retirement of Little Richard to become a preacher, prosecutions of Jerry Lee Lewis and Chuck Berry and the breaking of the [[payola]] scandal (which implicated major figures, including Alan Freed, in bribery and corruption in promoting individual acts or songs), gave a sense that the rock and roll era established at that point had come to an end.<ref>{{harvnb|Campbell|2008|p=99}}</ref>

The first four years of the 1960s have often been seen as an era of hiatus for rock and roll.{{sfn |Gilliland |1969 |loc=shows 20–21}} However, some authors have emphasised innovations and trends in this period without which future developments would not have been possible.<ref>B.

The instrumental rock and roll of performers such as [[Duane Eddy]], Link Wray and [[the Ventures]] was further developed by [[Dick Dale]], who added distinctive "wet" [[reverb]], rapid alternate picking, and [[Middle Eastern music|Middle Eastern]] and [[Music of Mexico|Mexican]] influences.

Surf music achieved its greatest commercial success as vocal pop music, particularly the work of [[the Beach Boys]], formed in 1961 in Southern California.

Blues rock bands often emulated jazz, playing long, involved improvisations, which would later be a major element of progressive rock.

In the late 1960s, jazz-rock emerged as a distinct subgenre out of the blues-rock, psychedelic, and progressive rock scenes, mixing the power of rock with the musical complexity and improvisational elements of jazz. [[AllMusic]] states that the term jazz-rock "may refer to the loudest, wildest, most electrified fusion bands from the jazz camp, but most often it describes performers coming from the rock side of the equation." Jazz-rock "...generally grew out of the most artistically ambitious rock subgenres of the late '60s and early '70s", including the singer-songwriter movement.<ref name="AMJazzRock" /> Many early US rock and roll musicians had begun in jazz and carried some of these elements into the new music. In Britain, the subgenre of blues rock, and many of its leading figures, like [[Ginger Baker]] and [[Jack Bruce]] of the band [[Cream (band)|Cream]], had emerged from the [[British jazz]] scene. Often highlighted as the first true jazz-rock recording is the only album by the relatively obscure New York–based [[the Free Spirits]] with ''[[Out of Sight and Sound]]'' (1966). The first group of bands to self-consciously use the label were R&B oriented white rock bands that made use of jazzy horn sections, like [[Electric Flag]], Blood, Sweat & Tears and [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]], to become some of the most commercially successful acts of the late 1960s and early 1970s.<ref name=Bogdanov2002JazzRock/>

British acts to emerge in the same period from the blues scene, to make use of the tonal and improvisational aspects of jazz, included [[Nucleus (band)|Nucleus]]<ref>I. Carr, D. Fairweather and B. Priestley, ''The Rough Guide to Jazz'' (London: Rough Guides, 3rd edn., 2004), {{ISBN|1-84353-256-5}}, p. iii.</ref> and the [[Graham Bond]] and John Mayall spin-off [[Colosseum (band)|Colosseum]]. From the psychedelic rock and the Canterbury scenes came Soft Machine, who, it has been suggested, produced one of the artistically successfully fusions of the two genres. Perhaps the most critically praised fusion came from the jazz side of the equation, with [[Miles Davis]], particularly influenced by the work of Hendrix, incorporating rock instrumentation into his sound for the album ''[[Bitches Brew]]'' (1970). It was a major influence on subsequent rock-influenced jazz artists, including [[Herbie Hancock]], [[Chick Corea]] and [[Weather Report]].<ref name=Bogdanov2002JazzRock/> The genre began to fade in the late 1970s, as a mellower form of fusion began to take its audience,<ref name=AMJazzRock>{{Citation|title=Jazz-Rock Music Genre Overview |work=AllMusic |url=http://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/jazz-rock-d2776 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110216015609/http://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/jazz-rock-d2776 |archive-date =16 February 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> but acts like [[Steely Dan]],<ref name=AMJazzRock/> Frank Zappa and [[Joni Mitchell]] recorded significant jazz-influenced albums in this period, and it has continued to be a major influence on rock music.<ref name=Bogdanov2002JazzRock>R.

Reflecting on developments that occurred in rock music in the early 1970s, [[Robert Christgau]] wrote in ''[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies]]'' (1981):<ref name="CG"/>
{{blockquote|The decade is, of course, an arbitrary schema itself—time doesn't just execute a neat turn toward the future every ten years. But like a lot of artificial concepts—money, say—the category does take on a reality of its own once people figure out how to put it to work. "The '60s are over," a slogan one only began to hear in 1972 or so, mobilized all those eager to believe that idealism had become passe, and once they were mobilized, it had. In popular music, embracing the '70s meant both an [[elitist]] withdrawal from the messy concert and [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] scene and a profiteering pursuit of the lowest common denominator in [[FM radio]] and [[album era|album rock]].}}

Rock saw greater commodification during this decade, turning into a multibillion-dollar industry and doubling its [[Market (economics)|market]] while, as Christgau noted, suffering a significant "loss of cultural prestige". "Maybe the [[Bee Gees]] became more popular than the Beatles, but they were never [[more popular than Jesus]]", he said. "Insofar as the music retained any mythic power, the myth was [[self-referential]] – there were lots of songs about the rock and roll life but very few about how rock could change the world, except as a new brand of painkiller ... In the '70s the powerful took over, as rock industrialists capitalized on the national mood to reduce potent music to an often reactionary species of entertainment—and to transmute rock's popular base from the audience to market."<ref name="CG"/>

The origins of glam rock are associated with [[Marc Bolan]], who had renamed his folk duo to [[T. Rex (band)|T. Rex]] and taken up electric instruments by the end of the 1960s. Often cited as the moment of inception is his appearance on the BBC music show ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' in March 1971 wearing glitter and satins, to perform what would be his second UK Top 10 hit (and first UK Number 1 hit), "[[Hot Love (T.

American working-class oriented heartland rock, characterized by a straightforward musical style and a concern with the lives of ordinary, [[blue-collar]] American people, developed in the second half of the 1970s. The term heartland rock was first used to describe [[American Midwest|Midwestern]] arena rock groups like [[Kansas (band)|Kansas]], [[REO Speedwagon]] and Styx, but which came to be associated with a more socially concerned form of roots rock more directly influenced by folk, country and rock and roll.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kirkpatrick |first=Rob |title=The Words and Music of Bruce Springsteen |year=2007 |publisher=Praeger |location=Westport, CT |isbn=978-0-275-98938-5 |page=51}}</ref> It has been seen as an American Midwest and [[Rust Belt]] counterpart to West Coast country rock and the Southern rock of the American South.<ref>{{harvnb|Thompson|2007|p=138}}</ref> Led by figures who had initially been identified with punk and new wave, it was most strongly influenced by acts such as Bob Dylan, the Byrds, Creedence Clearwater Revival and [[Van Morrison]], and the basic rock of 1960s garage and the Rolling Stones.<ref name=AllmusicHeartland>{{Citation|title=Heartland Rock |work=AllMusic |url={{AllMusic|class=explore|id=style/d7710|pure_url=yes}} |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5wT2uWL5o?url=http://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/d7710 |archive-date=13 February 2011 |url-status=dead}}.</ref>

Exemplified by the commercial success of singer songwriters [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Bob Seger]], and [[Tom Petty]], it was partly a reaction to post-industrial urban decline in the East and Mid-West, often dwelling on issues of social disintegration and isolation, beside a form of good-time rock and roll revivalism.<ref name=AllmusicHeartland/> The genre reached its commercial peak in the mid-1980s, with Springsteen's ''[[Born in the USA]]'' (1984) topping the charts worldwide and spawning a series of top ten singles, together with the arrival of artists including [[John Mellencamp]], [[Steve Earle]] and more gentle singer-songwriters such as [[Bruce Hornsby]].<ref name=AllmusicHeartland/>

Heartland rock faded away as a recognized genre by the early 1990s, as rock music in general, and blue-collar and white working class themes in particular, lost influence with younger audiences, and as heartland's artists turned to more personal works.<ref name=AllmusicHeartland/>

Punk rock was developed between 1974 and 1976 in the United States and the United Kingdom. Rooted in garage rock and other forms of what is now known as protopunk music, punk rock bands eschewed the perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock.<ref name=BogdanovPunk>J.

Punk quickly became a major cultural phenomenon in the UK.

Although punk rock was a significant social and musical phenomenon, it achieved less in the way of record sales (being distributed by small specialty labels such as [[Stiff Records]]),<ref>{{harvnb|Waksman|2009|p=157}}</ref> or American radio airplay (as the radio scene continued to be dominated by mainstream formats such as [[disco]] and [[album-oriented rock]]).<ref>E.

If hardcore most directly pursued the stripped down aesthetic of punk, and new wave came to represent its commercial wing, post-punk emerged in the late 1970s and early 1980s as its more artistic and challenging side. In addition to punk bands, major influences included [[the Velvet Underground]], [[the Stooges]] and [[Captain Beefheart]].<ref name="Bogdanov2002PostPunk">S.T.

The second generation of British post-punk bands that broke through in the early 1980s, including [[The Fall (band)|the Fall]], [[the Pop Group]], [[the Mekons]], [[Echo and the Bunnymen]] and [[the Teardrop Explodes]], tended to move away from dark sonic landscapes.<ref name="Bogdanov2002PostPunk"/> Arguably the most successful band to emerge from post-punk was Ireland's [[U2]], who incorporated elements of religious imagery together with political commentary into their often anthemic music, and by the late 1980s had become one of the biggest bands in the world.<ref>F.W.

The term alternative rock was coined in the early 1980s to describe rock artists who did not fit into the mainstream genres of the time. Bands dubbed "alternative" had no unified style, but were all seen as distinct from mainstream music.

Few of these early bands achieved mainstream success, although exceptions to this rule include R.E.M., the Smiths, and the Cure. Despite a general lack of spectacular album sales, the original alternative rock bands exerted a considerable influence on the generation of musicians who came of age in the 1980s and ended up breaking through to mainstream success in the 1990s. Styles of alternative rock in the US during the 1980s included [[jangle pop]], associated with the early recordings of R.E.M., which incorporated the ringing guitars of mid-1960s pop and rock, and college rock, used to describe alternative bands that began in the college circuit and college radio, including acts such as [[10,000 Maniacs]] and [[the Feelies]].<ref name=Bogdanov2002USAlternative/> In the UK, by the end of the 1980s, indie or dream pop bands like [[Primal Scream]] and [[the Wedding Present]],<ref>{{Citation|title=Twee as Fuck: The Story of Indie Pop |last=N.

In the latter half of the 1980s, bands in [[Washington (state)|Washington state]] (particularly in the [[Seattle]] area) formed a new style of rock that contrasted with the mainstream music of the time. The developing genre came to be known as "grunge", a term descriptive of the dirty sound of the music and the unkempt appearance of most musicians, who rebelled against the over-groomed images of other artists. Grunge made heavy use of [[distortion (guitar)|guitar distortion]], [[Distortion (music)|fuzz]], and [[audio feedback|feedback]].<ref name="allmusic grunge">{{Citation|title=Grunge |work=AllMusic |url={{AllMusic|class=explore|id=style/d2679|pure_url=yes}} |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5wT8KwMkr?url=http://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/d2679 |archive-date=13 February 2011 |url-status=dead}}.</ref> The lyrics were typically apathetic and angst-filled, and often concerned themes such as social alienation and entrapment, although it was also known for its dark humor and parodies of commercial rock.

Bands such as [[Green River (band)|Green River]], [[Soundgarden]], and [[Melvins]] pioneered the genre, with [[Mudhoney]] becoming the most successful by the end of the decade. Grunge remained largely a local phenomenon until 1991, when [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s album ''[[Nevermind]]'' became a huge success, containing the anthemic song "[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]".<ref>{{Citation|last=E.

Some post-grunge bands, like [[Candlebox]], were from Seattle, but the subgenre was marked by a broadening of the geographical base of grunge, with bands like York, Pennsylvania's [[Live (band)|Live]] and Georgia's [[Collective Soul]], and beyond the US to Australia's [[Silverchair]] and Britain's [[Bush (British band)|Bush]], who all cemented post-grunge as one of the most commercially viable subgenres of the mid-1990s.<ref name=Bogdanov2002USAlternative/><ref name=AllMusicPostgrunge/> Bands like [[Creed (band)|Creed]] and [[Nickelback]] took post-grunge into the late 1990s and 2000s with considerable commercial success, abandoning most of the angst and anger of the original movement for more conventional anthems,<ref name=Grierson/> narratives and romantic songs, and were followed in this vein by newer acts including [[Shinedown]], [[Seether]], [[3 Doors Down]] and [[Puddle of Mudd]].<ref name=Grierson>{{Citation|last=T.

Post-hardcore developed in the US, particularly in Chicago and Washington, D.C., in the 1980s, with bands that were inspired by the do-it-yourself ethics and guitar-heavy music of hardcore punk, but influenced by post-punk, adopting longer song formats, more complex musical structures and sometimes more melodic vocal styles.<ref name=AMPost-Hardcore>{{Citation|title=Post-hardcore |work=AllMusic |url=http://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/post-hardcore-d12962 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110505171528/http://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/post-hardcore-d12962 |archive-date=5 May 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Metalcore originated in the late 1980s combining elements of [[extreme metal]] and [[hardcore punk]].<ref name=Trapp>{{cite web |last=Trapp |first=Philip |title=Is Metalcore Metal? |url=https://loudwire.com/is-metalcore-metal/ |website=Loudwire |date=8 January 2024}}</ref> Metalcore is noted for its use of [[Breakdown (music)|breakdowns]], which are slow, intense passages conducive to [[moshing]], while other defining instrumentation includes heavy and percussive [[pedal point]] guitar [[riff]]s and [[double bass drumming]].

===Classic rock revival===

During the mid-to-late 2010s, some bands gained notoriety for emulating rock styles of the late 1960s and 1970s popular on [[classic rock]] radio. ''[[Guitar World]]'' described this back-to-basics revival as "hard-hitting, swaggering, riff-driven rock 'n' roll built around a core vocal-guitar-bass-drum configuration".<ref>{{Cite web |first=Brad |last=Angle |date=2021-07-09 |title=The new wave of classic rock: 15 guitar bands you need to know about |url=https://www.guitarworld.com/features/new-wave-of-classic-rock |access-date=2024-07-10 |website=Guitar World}}</ref> Groups considered to be a part of this trend include [[Greta Van Fleet]], [[Rival Sons]], and [[Larkin Poe]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Schaffner |first=Lauryn|date=2023-01-17 |title=11 Bands That Are Leading the Classic Rock Revival |url=https://loudwire.com/bands-leading-classic-rock-revival/ |access-date=2024-07-10 |website=Loudwire}}</ref>

Different subgenres of rock were adopted by, and became central to, the identity of a large number of [[sub-culture]]s. In the 1950s and 1960s, respectively, British youths adopted the [[Teddy Boys|Teddy Boy]] and [[Rocker (subculture)|rocker]] subcultures, which revolved around US rock and roll.<ref name="Brake; 1990; 73-9"/> The [[counterculture of the 1960s]] was associated with much of the rock music of the era.<ref name="Brake; 1990; 73-9">M.

Gibson, ''Fashion Cultures: Theories, Explorations, and Analysis'' (Abingdon: Routledge, 2000), {{ISBN|0-415-20685-5}}, p. 260.</ref> However, followers of rock music have often mistrusted the world of fashion, which has been seen as elevating image above substance.<ref name="Bruzzi et al; 2000; 260"/> Rock fashions have been seen as combining elements of different cultures and periods, as well as expressing divergent views on sexuality and gender, and rock music in general has been noted and criticised for facilitating greater sexual freedom.<ref name="Bruzzi et al; 2000; 260"/><ref>G.

Rock has been credited with changing attitudes to race by opening up [[African-American culture]] to white audiences. However, at the same time, rock has been accused of [[Cultural appropriation|appropriating]] and exploiting that culture.<ref>{{cite book|last=Fisher |first=Marc |title=Something in the Air: Radio, Rock, and the Revolution that Shaped a Generation |year=2007 |publisher=Random House |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0-375-50907-0 |page=53}}</ref><ref>M.T.

Since its early development, rock music has been associated with rebellion against social and political norms, most in early rock and roll's rejection of an adult-dominated culture, the counterculture's rejection of consumerism and conformity and punk's rejection of all forms of social convention;<ref>P. Wicke, ''Rock Music: Culture, Aesthetics and Sociology'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2nd edn., 1995), {{ISBN|0-521-39914-9}}, pp. 91–114.</ref> however, it can also be seen as providing a means of commercial exploitation of such ideas and of diverting youth away from political action.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Yazicioglu |first1=E.

===Role of women===
{{Main|Women in rock}}
[[File:Courtney Love Public Assembly Crop.png|thumb|[[Courtney Love]] performing with [[Hole (band)|Hole]] in 2012]]

According to Schaap and Berkers, playing in a band is a peer group experience "shaped by existing sex-segregated friendship networks".<ref name=SchaBerk101102 >J. Schaap and P. Berkers (2014), "Grunting Alone? Online Gender Inequality in Extreme Metal Music", ''IASPM Journal'', vol. 4, no. 1, pp. 101–102.</ref> They write: "Several scholars have argued that men exclude women from bands or from the bands' rehearsals, recordings, performances, and other social activities ... Women are mainly regarded as passive and private consumers of allegedly slick, prefabricated{{snd}}hence, inferior{{snd}}pop music, excluding them from participating as high status rock musicians".<ref name="SchaapandBerkers2014p104">J. Schaap and P. Berkers (2014), "Grunting Alone? Online Gender Inequality in Extreme Metal Music", ''IASPM Journal'', vol. 4, no. 1, p. 104.</ref>

In the early decades of rock music, rebellion "was largely a male rebellion; the women—often, in the 1950s and 60s, girls in their teens—in rock usually sang songs as personae, utterly dependent on their macho boyfriends."<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Oglesbee |first=Frank W. |date=1999 |title=Suzi Quatro: A prototype in the archsheology of rock |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03007769908591731 |journal=Popular Music and Society |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=29–39 |doi=10.1080/03007769908591731 |issn=0300-7766 |url-access=subscription}}</ref> Philip Auslander says that "although there were many women in rock by the late 1960s, most performed only as singers, a traditionally feminine position in popular music."<ref name="Auslander2004">{{cite journal |last=Auslander |first=Philip |date=28 January 2004 | title = I Wanna Be Your Man: Suzi Quatro's musical androgyny |journal=Popular Music |volume=23 |issue=1 | pages=1–16 |publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] |doi=10.1017/S0261143004000030 |s2cid=191508078 |access-date=25 April 2012 |url=http://lmc.gatech.edu/~auslander/publications/quatro.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524032035/http://lmc.gatech.edu/~auslander/publications/quatro.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=24 May 2013 |issn=0261-1430}}</ref> Some women played instruments in American [[All-female band|all-female garage rock bands]], but none of these bands achieved more than regional success. When [[Suzi Quatro]] emerged in 1973, "no other prominent female musician worked in rock simultaneously as a singer, instrumentalist, songwriter, and bandleader".<ref name="Auslander2004"/>

An [[all-female band]] is a musical group that is exclusively composed of [[female musician]]s. This is distinct from a girl group, in which the female members are vocalists, though this terminology is not universally followed.<ref>For example, vocalists [[Girls Aloud]] are referred to as a "girl band" in [http://www.ok.co.uk/fashion/view/8555/Meet-the-duo-dressing-Girls-Aloud ''OK'' magazine] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101120717/http://www.ok.co.uk/fashion/view/8555/Meet-the-duo-dressing-Girls-Aloud |date=1 November 2012 }} and [https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/nov/09/girlsaloud-thexfactor ''The Guardian''], while [[Girlschool]] are termed a "girl group" at the [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0320918/bio ''imdb''] and [https://archive.today/20120728103723/http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/music/reviews/the-hedrons-13401497.html?startindex=-1 ''Belfast Telegraph''].</ref>
