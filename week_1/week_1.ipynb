It is best known for its [[consumer electronics]], [[computer software|software]], and [[online service|service]]s. Founded in 1976 as Apple Computer Company by [[Steve Jobs]], [[Steve Wozniak]] and [[Ronald Wayne]], the company was incorporated by Jobs and Wozniak as Apple Computer, Inc. the following year. It was renamed Apple Inc. in 2007 as the company had expanded its focus from computers to consumer electronics. Apple is the [[largest technology company by revenue]], with {{US dollar|391.04}} billion in the 2024 [[fiscal year]].<!--END Brief intro; do not overload this section, keep it brief and simple.-->\\n\\n<!--Notable history & products-->The company was founded to produce and market Wozniak\\'s [[Apple I]] personal computer. Its second computer, the [[Apple II (original)|Apple II]], became a best seller as one of the first mass-produced [[microcomputer]]s. Apple introduced the [[Apple Lisa|Lisa]] in 1983 and the [[Macintosh 128K|Macintosh]] in 1984, as some of the first computers to use a [[graphical user interface]] and a [[computer mouse|mouse]]. By 1985, internal company problems led to Jobs leaving to form [[NeXT]], and Wozniak withdrawing to other ventures; [[John Sculley]] served as long-time CEO for over a decade. In the 1990s, Apple lost considerable [[market share]] in the [[personal computer]] industry to the lower-priced [[Wintel]] duopoly of the [[Microsoft Windows]] [[operating system]] on [[Intel]]-powered [[IBM PC compatible|PC clones]]. In 1997, Apple was weeks away from [[bankruptcy]]. To resolve its failed operating system strategy, it bought NeXT, effectively bringing Jobs back to the company, who guided Apple back to profitability over the next decade with the introductions of the [[iMac]], [[iPod]], [[iPhone]], and [[iPad]] devices to critical acclaim as well as the [[iTunes Store]], launching the \"[[Think different]]\" [[Apple Inc. advertising|advertising]] campaign, and opening the [[Apple Store]] retail chain. These moves elevated Apple to consistently be one of the world\\'s [[List of most valuable brands|most valuable brands]] since about 2010. Jobs resigned in 2011 for health reasons, and died two months later; he was succeeded as CEO by [[Tim Cook]].<!--END Notable history & products-->\\n\\n<!--Current products & status-->[[List of Apple products|Apple\\'s product lineup]] includes portable and home hardware such as the iPhone, iPad, [[Apple Watch]], [[Mac (computer)|Mac]], and [[Apple TV]]; [[List of Apple operating systems|operating systems]] such as [[iOS]], [[iPadOS]], and [[macOS]]; and [[List of software by Apple Inc.|various software]] and services including [[Apple Pay]], [[iCloud]], and multimedia [[Streaming media|streaming]] services like [[Apple Music]] and [[Apple TV+]].

Apple subsequently negotiated access to PARC\\'s technology, leading to Apple\\'s option to buy shares at a preferential rate. This visit influenced Jobs to implement a GUI in Apple\\'s products, starting with the [[Apple Lisa]]. Despite being pioneering as a mass-marketed GUI computer, the Lisa suffered from high costs and limited software options, leading to commercial failure.\\n\\nJobs, angered by being pushed off the Lisa team, took over the company\\'s [[Macintosh]] division. Wozniak and Raskin had envisioned the Macintosh as a low-cost computer with a text-based interface like the Apple II, but a plane crash in 1981 forced Wozniak to step back from the project.
